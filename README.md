### **Description**
QuantitativeSocietyLab is a structured collection of analytical frameworks and reproducible scripts for studying social systems through statistical and computational modeling.  
The repository unites the methodological foundation behind published work on inequality, labor markets, institutional change, and policy evaluation.  
Every model here is designed to connect empirical precision with interpretive depth — evidence should not only explain but also clarify how societies evolve.

---

### **Core Domains**
- **Structural Equation Modeling (SEM):** latent structures of social inequality and institutional effects  
- **Multilevel and Longitudinal Models:** trajectories of welfare regimes and demographic shifts  
- **Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE):** population-level dynamics in clustered social data  
- **Simulation and Comparative Models:** cross-national and policy-driven scenario analysis  
- **Mixed-Methods Integration:** quantitative inference aligned with qualitative interpretation  
- **Visualization and Reporting:** reproducible workflows in R for academic dissemination  

---

### **Toolchain**
`R` · `Python` · `Stata` · `SPSS` · `NVivo` · `LaTeX` · `Git`  
All scripts are annotated for methodological transparency and replication.
